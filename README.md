## Installation

You must install the sequelize and express packages in node. 
You can also install insomnia to help you test the routes. 

## Usage

- When I run npm start, the server listens on the specificed port. 
- The API routes listen for incoming requests and send back the responses to the client. 
- I add the JSON data to the body that I want to create for the specified routes and then am able to modify or delete that information as well as retrieve it.
